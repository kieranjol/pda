## summary ##

These are a python scripts and GUIs to facilitate personal archiving of still images. Right now, the catalog scripts are for my parents. They are scanning their personal photos, and using this software to catalog everything. The metadata is written to simple csv files, which I will later convert to Dublin Core XML. There are some basic fixity tools in here too.

## functions ##

#### catalog.py ####
* Usage: The script takes no arguments and is run with `python catalog.py`.This script links with catgui in order to provide a graphical user interface for cataloging digital images. You will be prompted to select an image directory. You can cycle through the images in the image viewer and add metadata as you go. The metadata will be saved in a CSV sidecar file whenever you enter new data and click either 'Next' or 'Previous'.

#### audit.py ####
* Usage: `python audit.py foldername`. This script scans subfolders and creates a csv spreadsheet audit of digital images using exiftool. It is currently focused on digital camera content, and tries to retrieve information such as camera lens/fstop/iso/shutter speed etc.

#### csv2dublincore.py 
* Currently just a proof of concept with no real use. This will take the csv file that is generated by catalog.py and turn it into Dublin Core XML. 

#### fixity.py
* Usage: `python fixity.py directoryname`. This analyses a directory and all of its subfolders to see if md5 sidecars exist. If they do not exist, it creates them. My parents use a compiled, binary executable of this script where the path that contains their scans is hardcoded. All they have to do is open the exe, and the script generates checksums if required.
